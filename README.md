This repository is for configurations for my home machines, including public cloud VM
instances, home servers, and desktops. This used to be a grab bag of
[Nomad](http://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad),
[Ansible](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible),
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and
[Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform). It's now been rewritten almost
entirely using [Nix and NixOS](https://nixos.org/). A few bits still rely on OCI
containers, but I aim to be rid of that someday.
